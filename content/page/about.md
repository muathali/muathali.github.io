I am passionate about building business applications with special focus on cloud-native technologies, Microsoft Azure in particular.

Started programming in my early years in college when I stumbled upon a coding book, the title was `The C Programming Language` .. I was hooked.

I had always wanted to create Art, but never found a venue that worked for me, and then, I felt like coding was that, I found that I could be creative and analytical all at the same time â€¦ Ah, that is all I wanted to do.

Trained as an Engineer, I paved my way through the industry by working for some of the most successful IT companies in the US and abroad, when not working, I am usually busy making the next best picture, trying to master the art of composition, light & digital photography to capture that perfect moment.

I live with my wife Basma in the beautiful city of Charlotte, North Carolina. I do enjoy biographies, cooking and a good game of football .. Hala Madrid!

I love meeting new people and learning new things, feel free to drop me a note, say hello and share a story.
