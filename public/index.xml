      <description>Quick git facts to better understand how it works
Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot;
They can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are everything else – any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything.</description>
